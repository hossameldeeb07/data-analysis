    "● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.\n",
